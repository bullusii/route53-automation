### WHAT IS THIS
This is a script that show how one could automate the creation of:
1. Creation of HOSTED ZONE
2. Request of a ACM certificate within that subdomain
3. Creation of record in route53 to enable DNS certificate renewal  (this can take up to an hour to validate)

### DISCLAIMER
USE THIS CODE AT YOUR OWN RISK
The script was written on MAC OS and may require some tweaking to work properly on other forms of linux.
